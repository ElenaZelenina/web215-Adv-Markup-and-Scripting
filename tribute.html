            <h3>
                Here are some facts of Bender's biography:
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Bender, a high-tech industrial metalworking robot, was built in 2996 at Fábrica Robótica De La Madre
                    (Spanish: "Mom's Robot Factory"), a manufacturing facility of Mom's Friendly Robot Company in
                    Tijuana,
                    Mexico.</li>
                <li>Unlike most other robots, Bender is mortal and, according to Professor Farnsworth's calculations,
                    may
                    have less than one billion years to live. Because of a manufacturing error that left Bender without
                    a
                    backup unit, Bender's memory cannot be transferred or uploaded to another robot body.</li>
                <li>At the factory, Bender was programmed for cold-bending structural steel. Bender later attended
                    Bending
                    State University, where he majored in bending and minored in Robo-American Studies. </li>
                <li>Before meeting Fry and Leela and joining Planet Express (where he currently works as the assistant
                    manager of sales), Bender had a job at the metalworking factory, bending steel girders for the
                    construction of suicide booths.</li>
                <li>Bender has an apartment in the "Robot Arms Apts." building, where he eventually invites his best
                    friend
                    and coworker, Fry, to live with him.</li>
                <li>Professor Farnsworth describes Bender to be constructed of an alloy of iron and osmium. Bender hates
                    magnets, as magnets interfere with his inhibition unit, causing him to uncontrollably start singing
                    folk
                    songs when near his head; and also causing him to reveal his secret ambition to be a folk singer.
